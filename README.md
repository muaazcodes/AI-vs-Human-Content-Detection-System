## 🤖 AI vs Human Text Detector

This project is a **machine learning–based web application** that detects whether a given text is **AI-generated** or **human-written**.
It uses linguistic and statistical features such as readability, sentence structure, and lexical diversity to make predictions.

---

### 🧠 Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **NumPy**
* **Pandas**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Seaborn**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **TextStat**
* **Streamlit**

---

### ⚙️ Features

* Detects whether input text is written by a human or generated by AI
* Calculates readability and writing style metrics
* Displays extracted linguistic features
* Interactive, modern dark-themed UI built with Streamlit
* Uses a trained Scikit-learn **Pipeline.pkl** model for prediction

---

### 🧩 How It Works

1. The user pastes a paragraph or text in the Streamlit app.
2. The app extracts linguistic features (word count, sentence count, readability, etc.).
3. These features are passed to a **machine learning pipeline** for prediction.
4. The model then classifies the content as either:

   * 🟢 **Human-Written**
   * 🔴 **AI-Generated**

---

### 🚀 Run the Project

```bash
# 1️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install streamlit numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn textstat

# 2️⃣ Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open the link shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`) to access the app.

### 🌟 Example Use

Paste a paragraph in the app and click **“Detect”** — the app will analyze your text and display whether it’s AI or Human along with extracted features in a clean dashboard.
